A general authentication application, which you can use for your future projects as basic sign in sign up template
it included jwt, google OAuth as well.

First dealing with front-end\
vite used for creating this project, tailwind css installed using 
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite

initialize git using git init, then git add ., then git commit -m 'your msg' then go to your git hub account
create the repo there 

We will make pages and then define the routes for them as well.
Define those routes in app.jsx

now some backend setup, npm run dev will keep track of changes npm start will just start

Now time for setting the database, mongodb we will use for this project

mongodb+srv://ahsan:ahsan123@mernauth.hfsfzih.mongodb.net/mern-auth?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=mernAuth

/mern-auth added by myself as this will suggest db name

mongodb is not connecting due to network error let's sort it tomorrow, ok using lower node version

Now I will make create the model for mongodb

create the models folder, and add user in it

create a separate folder for routes as well, and then for controllers main logic will be in controllers

implement function in controller and then call that in routes

add middleware for handling errors

for custom error handling like show users if they haven't fill form create new folder utils and add in there

Now further add the sign up page structure, so now some work with client side
